## 📌 Overview

This repository hosts the full implementation of our research on **explainable socioeconomic analysis using high-resolution satellite imagery and open-source large language models (LLMs)**. The framework is designed to provide interpretable, scalable insights into **urban infrastructure, housing typologies, and spatial economic conditions** across cities using **multimodal AI techniques**.

🧩 **Multimodal Inputs**: Satellite imagery, geographic references, and semantic prompts  
🧠 **AI Backbone**: LLMs for prompt-based reasoning and geospatial parsing  
📈 **Outputs**: Socioeconomic class mapping, infrastructure summaries, radar charts, and entropy indices (e.g., SESI, Gini)

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 **Geospatial Referencing** via Google Earth URLs
- 🔎 **AI-Driven Prompting** for housing type and infrastructure interpretation
- 🏙️ **Multimodal Feature Extraction** (roof materials, road density, proximity to amenities)
- 📊 **Semantic Parsing of Geospatial JSON Data**
- 📉 **Radar-Based Visualization** of Urban Typologies
- 🧮 **Socioeconomic Spread Index (SESI)** via Shannon Entropy
- 🧠 **Gini Coefficient Analysis** for class inequality
- 📂 Easy-to-understand tables, charts, and exports

## 🗺️ Use Case

> **Urban Intelligence for Policy and Planning**

This project supports:
- **Smart city development**
- **NGO-targeted interventions**
- **Infrastructure equity audits**
- **Socioeconomic disparity visualization**
